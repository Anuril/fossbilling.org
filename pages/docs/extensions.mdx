# Working Extensions and Payment Modules

For an up to date list of current extensions, please check out the [Extension Directory](https://extensions.fossbilling.org/).

You can then download and install extensions from the extension directory directly in your FOSSBilling installation.

* Keep in mind, that FOSSBilling is currently considered pre-production software. While we are working hard to make it production-ready, we do not recommend using it in production yet.

See [this issue on github](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/issues/1360) for more information regarding plans for Payment Adapters.
