# Working Extensions and Payment Modules

Also take a look at the [Extension Directory](https://extensions.fossbilling.org/) where you can find more extensions and payment modules.
We are working on making it as complete as possible.

You can then download and install extensions from the extension directory directly in your FOSSBilling installation.

* Keep in mind, that FOSSBilling is currently considered pre-production software. While we are working hard to make it production-ready, we do not recommend using it in production yet.

See [this issue on github](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/issues/1360) for more information regarding plans for Payment Adapters.
