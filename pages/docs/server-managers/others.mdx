title: Other Server Managers
---

## Current stance on other server managers

At this time, FOSSBilling only supports CPW, HestiaCP and WHM/cPanel, as server managers. 

While we have received requests for support of other server managers, we are currently focusing on improving the stability and usability of FOSSBilling before adding support for additional server managers.

We appreciate your interest in FOSSBilling and welcome contributions from the community. 
If you are interested in contributing to FOSSBilling, check out visit the [contribution handbook](https://fossbilling.org/docs/contribution-handbook/guides/creating-a-server-manager) for more information.

## Proxmox VE Support

There is a Proxmox VE module available for FOSSBilling. 
While Version 0.0.5 is largely not functional **and should not be used in production**, development is ongoing and we hope to have a working version available soon.
Current progress can be tracked on the Modules [Github Repo](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/Proxmox).

## Special Mentions

### Pterodactyl

Pterodactyl is a game server manager that is often requested by the community.
Currently, there is no active development on a Pterodactyl module for FOSSBilling from the FOSSBilling Team.

However, there are community members who have been working on a Pterodactyl module for FOSSBilling. 
See [here](https://github.com/timmy-time/FOSSBilling-Pterodactyl/) and [here](https://github.com/fabpot-del/Pterodactyl-FOSSBilling) and 

In the interest of progress in this matter, we encourage you to check out his work and contribute to the project if you are able.
