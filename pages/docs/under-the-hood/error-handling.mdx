title: Error Handling
---

# Error Handling

There is a class called `Box_Exception` that is used to handle errors. 

It takes 4 parameters. The first is the error message, the second is an array of variables to be used in the error message, the third is the error code, and the fourth is a boolean that tells the exception if the variables should be protected.

## Example

```php
throw new \Box_Exception('Module :mod: does not have service class', array(':mod:'=>$this->mod), 3);
```

# Error Codes

To make it easier to handle errors, we are assignig errorcodes to the errors so we can easily identify them.
Currently, only the FOSSBilling Loader uses error codes according to this list, the rest of the code is still very "wild" and is in the process of being cleaned up.

## 0000 - 0399 | 0600 - 1999 Core Error Codes

Error Codes 400 to 599 are reserved for HTTP error codes so we won't re-use them.

Core errors are errors that are caused by the core of the system.
F.ex if the database is down, or if the core is missing a file.

We broke the core errors into more categories as below.

| Category                              | Number Range   |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| FOSSBilling Loader errors             | 1 - 50         |
