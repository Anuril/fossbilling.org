title: Error Handling
---

# Error Handling

There is a class called `Box_Exception` that is used to handle errors. 

It takes 4 parameters. The first is the error message, the second is an array of variables to be used in the error message, the third is the error code, and the fourth is a boolean that tells the exception if the variables should be protected.

## Example

```php
throw new \Box_Exception('Module :mod does not have service class', array(':mod'=>$this->mod), 3);
```

# Error Codes

To make it easier to handle errors, in the Future, we are going to rewrite the error handling to use error codes.
Currently, only the FOSSBilling Loader uses error codes according to this list, the rest of the code is still very "wild" and will get updated for 0.6.0.

## FOSSBilling Loader Error Codes

Codes 1 to 50 are reserved for FOSSBilling Loader errors.

| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | The composer packages are missing. |
| 2 | For security reasons, you have to delete the install directory before you can use FOSSBilling. |
| 3 | The FOSSBilling configuration file is empty or invalid. |
| 4 | Migration from BoxBilling is required. |
| 5 | Missing .htaccess file |


## 0000 - 0399 | 0600 - 1999 Core Error Codes

Error Codes 400 to 599 are reserved for HTTP error codes. so we won't re-use them.

Core errors are errors that are caused by the core of the system.
F.ex if the database is down, or if the core is missing a file.
