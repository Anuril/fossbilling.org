# FOSSBilling Changelog

## 0.5.1 (6-23-2023)
This is a fairly minor release, with enhanced security, some bug-fixes, and new default email templates.

### Security
 - `Box_Session` has been replaced with `FOSSBilling\Session`
    - Session IDs are now forcibly regenerated when logging in, preventing  a session fixation vulnerability. [Vulnerability report](https://huntr.dev/bounties/84bf3e85-cdeb-4b8d-9ea4-74156dbda83f/).
    - The `BOXCLR` cookie has been completely removed from within FOSSBilling.
    - Sessions are now destroyed when logging out.
    - Cron will automatically purge outdated sessions.
    - FOSSBilling now implements a simple fingerprinting method for sessions to help prevent against session hijacking.
       - Only hashes of the fingerprinted data are recorded, not the data itself.
  - We've added protection against certain twig filters that would allow remote code execution which could be exploited by anyone with access to either theme or email templates. ([Vulnerability report](https://huntr.dev/bounties/e4df9280-900a-407a-a07e-e7fef3345914/))
  - The company signature will not longer be interpreted as HTML inside of the Huraga theme, as it could allow a malicious staff member to perform XSS against clients. ([Vulnerability report](https://huntr.dev/bounties/e44589cd-d260-48c3-8fb9-0385d0f6adb1/))
  - The entropy for invoice and ticket hashes has been significantly increased.

### Bug fixes
 - We've fixes issues with both the option to disable client signups as well as preventing them from changing their email.
 - The order screen will no longer cause the Huraga layout to break. 
 - Fixed a minor problem a handful of people got with the locale selector.
 - Fixed an issue where the API was looking for the wrong property name when trying to update the client's city.
 - Added checks to prevent errors logged when FOSSBilling would try to access and undefined variable.

### New Features
 - We've replaced the default markdown email templates with ones that are HTML based and include some simplistic styling.
    - Existing FOSSBilling installations will need to manually reset existing templates in order for these new ones to be loaded. 

## 0.5.0 (6-13-202)
**Important:** We have changed the way update patches are performed. After updating, you **MUST** manually login to the administrator panel, navigate to the updater, and then use the "Apply Patches & Update Configuration" button. this will be automated going forward but must be done manually with this update.

Additionally: If you have any type of custom module, please read the breaking changes. Very nearly **ALL** custom modules will not work correctly in this release unless updated for it.

### Security
 - Resolved an issue with the "Downloadable" product type that allowed orders to be downloadable without being activated. ([Report on Huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/390643f0-106b-4424-835d-52610aefa4c7/))
     - Currently the description for this report is inaccurate, we are working with the security researcher and Huntr.dev administrators to get it updated.
 - Additional checks have been added to prevent add-ons from being ordered by themselves or for a product they are not valid for. ([Report #1](https://huntr.dev/bounties/0a7ee1fb-e693-4259-abf8-a2c3218c1647/) and [report #2](https://huntr.dev/bounties/97ecf4b8-7eeb-4e39-917c-2660262ff9ba/))
 - Prevented an issue that allowed disabled products from being ordered. ([Huntr.dev report](https://huntr.dev/bounties/31f48ca1-e5e8-436f-b779-cad597759170/))

### New Features
 - Introduced support for our "Central Alerts" system, allowing FOSSBilling to retrieve and display warnings associated with the currently running version.
 - We've introduced the usage of Monolog, splitting logging out into a handful of files to help keep logs more organized.
 - Our GitHub repository now runs automated spellchecks against changes to help prevent accidental spelling mistakes from being introduced into the application.
 - The old error page has been completely replaced and errors can now be assigned helpful links to help aid in debugging.
 - The API wrapper will now display a "spinner" on the page while waiting on an API request to complete, giving a visual indication that an action is being performed.
     - To use this, your custom theme will need to have a `spinner-border` class that implements the spinner animation. The API wrapper will automatic center it for you.
     - You can see this spinner in action inside of the administrator panel.

### Bug Fixes
 - The WHM/cPanel server manger now correctly assigns a default port when you don't manually specify it.
 - Fixed the link that can be used to view what emails a client has been sent.
 - Fixed an issue that could prevent you from updating an invoice if it's approval status isn't set.
 - We've fixed a few minor issues with the automatic language detection.
 - Multiple issues have been fixed with the orderbutton module.
 - The order screen will now correctly respect the product priority.
 - Resolved some minor PHP deprecation warnings.
 - Fixed a bug with the Namecheap registrar adapter that occurred when you had the `Reseller ID` set.
 - Fixed some SQL errors that could occur when updating a client.
 - FOSSBilling will now correctly prevent upgrade request tickets from being made for upgrades that are invalid for the associated product.
 - Fixed an issue that caused promotions to not properly be applied to the client balance, resulting in a negative balance.
 - FOSSBilling will now re-check the promotion validity before the checkout step is completed. This prevents instances where a promotion could be used after it was disabled as long as the promotion had already been applied to the cart.
 - The breadcrumbs on the Formbuilder module have been fixed and the overall layout has been slightly improved.

### Changes
 - FOSSBilling will no longer attempt to email the administrator after the installation is first complete.
 - Removed `getSettingsRoutes` and `hasSettingsRoutes` from out modules as the front-end no longer used them.
 - When changing the password for a client with the WHM/cPanel server manager, the client's DB password will also be updated.

### Enhancements
 - The ticket view has been cleaned up in the admin panel.

### Breaking Changes
 - `Box_Di` has been removed in favor of just using `\Pimple\Container` for typehints.
 - All FOSSBilling classes have been moved to the FOSSBilling namespace, removing the `FOSSBilling_` prefix from the class name.
 - FOSSBilling classes now enable strict types.
 - `Box\InjectionAwareInterface` has been replaced with `\FOSSBilling\InjectionAwareInterface`. Almost **ALL** custom modules will be broken unless they are updated to reflect this change.

## 0.4.3 (4-25-2023)
**Important** This release migrates to using `symfony/mailer` for sending emails. For mostly everyone, this will improve reliability of the emails and allow us to more easily maintain that functionality, however it is important to note that FOSSBilling now requires the `open_proc` function when using `sendmail` as your transport. Please check the release notes below for further information on this change.

### New features
 - FOSSBilling will now try to automatically detect the correct locale for users based on the browser's `HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` header. This option can be overridden with the language selector.
 - Server managers may now define a custom `generateUsername` function.
 - Custom themes may now gain access to the `admin_default` encore by setting `use_admin_default_encore` to `true` in their manifest file. This allows them to use JS and CSS from the admin theme.

### Enhancements
 - We have significantly cleaned up the CSS files for the `admin_default` theme. The outdated CSS from BoxBilling is now completely gone and we are now using slightly different autoprefixer rules. The resulting CSS is now roughly half of the size compared to FOSSBilling version 0.4.2
 - Cleaned up Huraga's CSS to removed outdated browser prefixes. This removes a little over 1k lines of unneeded CSS.
 - The `admin_default` theme has had numerous improvements, including having some pages rewritten.
 - The SEO module has had a minor overhaul.
 - We've made many improvements to the translatable strings inside of FOSSBilling, fixing some poor grammar and lowering the word-count by roughly 700 words compared to 0.4.2.
 - We've migrated to using `symfony/mailer` to handle emails. This will make it much more straightforward for us to add support for new transport options while also improving reliability and maintainability for the email functionality.
    - If you have been using the `sendmail` transport, FOSSBilling now requires the `open_proc` function to be enabled. It should be by default in most installations, however some control panels or hosting providers may disable it.
    - The option to disable SSL/TLS has been completely removed.
        - You may use a custom mailer DSN with `verify_peer` set to 0 if you want to connect to a host with a self-signed certificate. An example and link to further documentation is available in the email settings page.
     - The SendGrid integration has been updated to use the `symfony/mailer` package and now uses an API key instead of a username and password. We are unsure if the previous integration worked correctly, but if you were using it you will need to update to using an API key.
    - The `Box_Mail` class has been completely replaced with a new `FOSSBilling_Mail` class and it is no longer available through the `di`.

### Bug fixes
 - The client profile page will now correctly respect what parameters you have configured as required.
 - We've fixed an issue that prevented you from editing a promotion period.
 - Fixed a bug that could prevent access to the MassMailer module.
 - The "bring your own domain" option will now work correctly if a client doesn't enter a period into the TLD. (Both `.com` and `com` will work now)
 - Various fixes to the Direct Admin server manager.
 - Fixed an issue that could occasionally be seen where the next invoice number was being interpreted as a string rather than an integer.
 - Fixed the ResellerClub registrar's HTTP response handling.
 - Fixed server manager logging.
 - Fixed an error that could be seen if you tried to create a client without selecting a group.
 - Fixed an issue that could give an SQL error when trying to cancel an invoice.

### Changes
- The `Box_Config` class has been removed.
- We've entirely removed the FTP layer from FOSSBilling as it was unused and likely broken.
- We've removed `http-client` in favor of instancing the class directly.
- The `Box_Zip` class has been removed in favor of directly calling the ZIP library.
- Renamed the `Box_Requirements` and `Box_Version` classes to `FOSSBilling_Requirements` and `FOSSBilling_Version`.
- Minor changes to reflect the Extension Store being renamed to Extension Directory.
- We've removed a lot of functionality from the `Box_Request` class and have moved to using native PHP functionality.
- `Box_Tools` has had a lot of functionality removed as it duplicated standard PHP functions.
- System updated functionality has been moved from `Extensions` to `System`
- Removed the `Box_Cookie`, `Box_ExceptionAuth`, and `Box_Response` classes.
- `Box_Extension` has been replaced with `ExtensionManager`

## 0.4.2 (4-6-2023)
**Important** Due to issues related to sub-folders and additional complexity, we have decided to remove official support for FOSSBilling installations under sub-folders rather than sub-domains. Long term, we wish to bring back official support, however we give no timeline for this. This was previously announced on [our forum](https://forum.fossbilling.org/d/25-fossbilling-will-no-longer-provide-official-support-for-sub-folder-installations).

### Bug Fixes
- Reverted the bugfix for sub-folder installations as it caused issues with other installation methods.

### Enhancements
- We've improved the way localization is handled within twig, it will now respect the locale selected from within the dashboard. This allows clients to have dates translated into their locale.
- Fixed the mobile responsiveness of the Fix order "history" tab.
- Added badges to the dashboard to display the number of unpaid invoices, open tickets, etc.
- We've applied a simple fix to change the text color of CKEditor (WYSIWYG editor) when dark mode is enabled.
- Improved `.htaccess` rules to strengthen security, improve error handling, and to clean up some unnecessary rules.

## 0.4.1 (4-4-2023)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue that prevented access to the administrator panel if FOSSBilling is installed on a sub-folder.
    - **Important**: this style of installation is highly discouraged. Please use a sub-domain instead.
- Fixed an issue that prevented access to the administrator panel if the admin prefix was changed to no longer be `/admin`.
- Fixed an issue with the `.htaccess` file that prevented access to payment gateway logos.
- FOSSBilling now includes `symfony/polyfill-intl-icu`, which will be used as a polyfill if the `intl` extension is not installed & enabled in PHP.
   - This polyfill only supports the `en` locale, and is only being included to prevent FOSSBilling from being unusable without the `intl` extension. For full functionality, you should always ensure this extension is installed and enabled.

## 0.4.0 (4-3-2023)

### Breaking Changes
 - Both the client and admin `change_password` API endpoints now require password verification.
   - These are now the required parameters: `current_password`, `new_password`, and `confirm_password`.
 - jQuery has been updated to v3 from v1.7 for the administrator panel, and a lot of old jQuery plugins have been removed.
 - The `bbmd` twig filter has now been completely removed, the `markdown` filter should be used instead.
 - We've dropped official support for VestaCP due to its unmaintained status, if you use a fork of VestaCP that was using its server manager, you can find a backup of it [here](https://github.com/jaapmarcus/FOSSBilling-vesta/tree/main)
 - We've moved all twig filters that were outside of their class back inside of it.
 - The `bb_date` and `bb_datetime` filters have been removed in favor of official twig filters that offer better i18n support.
   - With this, dates should now be translated to your locale.
   - For those of you with custom themes / modules, you need to perform these replacements:
    - `bb_date` => `format_date`
    - `bb_datetime` => `format_datetime` 
  - Email templates will automatically be updated as part of the `foss-update.php` script.
  - Some configuration options in the `config.php` file have been changed or removed as part of the i18n efforts:
    - old (Default values shown):
      ```
      'timezone' => 'UTC',
      'locale' => 'en_US',
      'locale_date_format' => 'l, d F o',
      'locale_time_format' => ' G:i:s',
      ```
    - New (Default values shown):
      ```
      'i18n' => [
        'locale' => 'en_US',
        'timezone' => 'UTC',

        // Short names for formats (none, short, medium, long).
        // @see https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.intldateformatter.php
        'date_format' => 'medium',
        'time_format' => 'short',

        // Specifying a pattern will override the above date/time options. 
        // @see https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/datetime/#datetime-format-syntax
        'datetime_pattern' => '',
      ],
      ```
  - The `guzzlehttp/guzzle` dependency has been completely removed in favor of the `symfony/http-client` package.
  - We've completely removed the `array_get` function from the `di`. If you had a custom module, you should instead use a standard PHP ternary operator, which offers the same functionality while requiring less code and being easier to read for developers.
  - `boxbilling.message` is no longer available in the default admin theme. Custom modules should instead use `fossbilling.message`

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed the way email codes are generated.
 - Fixed the FormBuilder module.
 - Fixed broken Gravatars for the client ticket page.
 - Fixed an issue that could cause blank notifications.
 - Fixed an issue that prevented editing an IDN TLD.
 - Fixed some errors that could prevent PDF generation if debug mode is enabled.
 - Fixed some duplicated IDs on the Huraga settings page.
 - Fixed an issue that prevented clients from saving their profile changes.
 - The Virtualmin server manager has had some bugfixes.
 - We've fixed an issue with the twig `number_filter` filter that could prevent you from viewing a client's profile in rare situations. ([Issue #964](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/issues/964))
 - Fixed Gravatars on the activities tab in the admin panel.
 - Fixed some payment and server manager exceptions that were broken after we made them translatable.
 - Fixed the currencylayer integration
  - **Note:** The API endpoint for currencylayer has been updated from `https://api.currencylayer.com/live` to `https://api.apilayer.com/currency_data/live`.
    - If you have an older account with currencylayer, you may need to create a new account through apilayer to ensure it works correctly.
    - Apilayer is now the owner of currencylayer and is maintaining two API endpoints for the service. When you create an account for currencylayer, you will be directed to the apilayer website, where you can find the new, updated API endpoint.
    - We are using the apilayer API endpoint as it offers new functionality and seems to be the preferred option by apilayer, the current owner of currencylayer.
 - Fixed an issue where the cart wasn't remembering a selected period for a product.
 - Fixed content type header for the generated sitemap. (example.com/sitemap.xml)

### Enhancements

 - Product categories and descriptions will now be displayed when ordering.
 - The color picker in the Administrator panel has been replaced with a newer, better one.
 - FOSSBilling will automatically redirect you to the login page after updating. (This will apply for future updates AFTER 0.4.0)
 - The option to update assigned server IPs has been made visible.
 - We've added in the `symfony/http-client` package and started to use that instead of curl `calls`, which improves compatibility.
 - The admin panel has had its layout significantly improved. It's now much more responsive to different resolutions and the sidebar navigation has been replaced with a horizontal navbar.
 - The following modules have had their admin layouts reworked: `Cookieconsent`, `Spamchecker`, `Formbuilder`, `Embed`, `Custompages`, `Massmailer`, `Orderbutton`, `Redirect`, `Redirect`, `SEO Tools`, `Staff`, `Theme`, `Wysiwyg`.
 - We've cleaned up and fixed some inconsistencies in the `admin_default` theme. 

### New Features
 - We've refactored the way payment gateway logos are loaded, so they now no longer need to be hard-coded into a theme's CSS.
 - We've started implementing native JS modals for the Administrator panel, and have started using that instead of jQuery-based solutions inside the admin panel.
 - You can now export CSVs of orders, invoices, and clients. If you are working on a custom module, you can use `table_export_csv` from the DI to export a table as a CSV.
 - The foss-update.php script has undergone visual enhancements and now includes support for performing file-level operations.
  - These file operations include deleting, renaming, and moving files which will allow us to make the update process smoother in the future and remove any unused dependencies.
